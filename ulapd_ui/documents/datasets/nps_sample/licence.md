# National Polygon Service sample data

## Data Exploration Licence for the Geospatial Commission Partner Bodies

* Is free of charge.

* Lets you use HMLR Data for 12 months, unless we tell you, or you and we agree, something else. It will renew automatically every 12 months unless either of you or we choose to end it. ‘HMLR Data’ means any HMLR datasets that you have access to but not Third Party HMLR Data. This Licence will automatically end if 24 months have elapsed since your last request for updates to any Exploration Data.

* We use Ordnance Survey data in the preparation of the polygons and property addresses contained within the Exploration Data. Therefore these license terms are by licence with Ordnance Survey

* Includes both this page and the small print below. Please read all terms before accessing any HMLR Data or Third Party HMLR Data (together Exploration Data) so that you understand this Licence and what we agree you can and can’t do with Exploration Data.

* Lets you do any of the things we list below.


## So you can:
* Evaluate Exploration Data to see if what we’re offering is what you need.

* Use Exploration Data to research and develop your ideas and propositions. It doesn’t matter if you’re not sure yet how Exploration Data might help you. For example, you may want to assess it for a potential commercial opportunity or see what potential benefits and value it could bring to you, helping you build your case for licensing Exploration Data for use in your business or organisation. Note these research and development rights are subject to the provisions below regarding live trials or tests

* Display Exploration Data or create working prototypes using Exploration Data to demonstrate and promote on your own equipment how your ideas or propositions for using our data would work, which is ideal if you’re talking to potential customers, agents, investors or other financial backers. With our prior agreement, you can also provide prototypes for a short time to any of these people on equivalent terms to this Licence solely to help them to make a better assessment of your idea or proposition. We will work with you to enable this to happen, where possible.

* Use Exploration Data (excluding AddressBase® Islands) in live trials or tests within your business or organisation for up to 3 months to determine whether you wish to license it as an internal business aid immediately after your live trial.

* Use small extracts of HMLR Data (or data created from it under another licence) in time-bound events that promote collaboration and innovation, to provide better insight into specific uses or develop ideas or answer particular questions, for example, as part of competitions, hackathons and mash-ups.

* Publish small extracts of HMLR Data to promote your use of HMLR Data in articles and at events that intend to share or widen knowledge (such as academic papers, trade journals or industry conferences).


## In return, we ask you to:
* Provide us with information about you and/or your company or organisation as requested when you register to access Exploration Data so that we know who we are licensing and what you are wanting to do.

* Acknowledge that you’re using Exploration Data and that you’re doing so in the right way. You cannot reproduce the HMLR logo unless it forms an integral part of the Exploration Data and you are reproducing it in that context

* Make sure any prototypes you provide or any HMLR Data you provide (or data created from it under another HMLR licence) is returned to you or destroyed within 7 days of the end of the assessment or event. Tell us in advance if doing this might disrupt your longer term plans and we can discuss appropriate licensing.

* Take sensible measures to make sure all Exploration Data supplied to you is secure from any unauthorised use or access. For the purpose of auditing compliance with the terms of this Licence and for the prevention and/or detection of crime you will maintain accurate, complete and detailed records relating to this Licence regarding access to the Exploration Data by your staff including unauthorised access and information regarding any prototypes created.


## Under this Licence you must not do the following:
* Unless we expressly permit you to do so above, make any Exploration Data available to third parties or create any products or services which have benefitted from, relied on or made any use of Exploration Data (including, without limitation, where you have created your products or services by copying, publishing, modifying, re-formatting, analysing or performing searches, look ups or enquiries using Exploration Data). You agree that, if you want to make Exploration Data available in this way, you will tell us and will not proceed until we agree the basis on which that can happen.

            We register legal estates, or ownership, and legal interests (legal rights or restrictions). Overseas
            companies
            that own property
            in England and Wales describes registered legal estates relating to land or property where the registered
            legal
            owner is an
            overseas company (a company incorporated outside of the UK).
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The data includes titles registered by the following owner types of:</p>

            <li>limited liability partnerships</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">The data excludes titles registered by the following owner types of:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>private individuals</li>
            <li>UK companies with an overseas address</li>
            <li>charities</li>

            If an excluded owner type is the sole owner, all the details (such as address, name and correspondence
            address,
            tenure, title) will
            be excluded from the dataset.

            If a registered title is owned by both included and excluded owner types, the excluded owner details will be

            proprietorship and correspondence address columns.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Example: when a property is owned by a limited company and private individuals, we will supply the details
            of
            the property address, tenure, title
            and the name and correspondence address for the limited company, but will remove all reference to the
            private
            individuals. The Additional Proprietor
            indicator serves to highlight the existence of other proprietors in the register.

            Email addresses and British Forces Post Office addresses have been removed from the correspondence address

            The information provided regarding owners may not always reflect the up to date position in the Register, as

        <p class="govuk-body">
            The source data is from citizens and conveyancers supplied on registration deeds and documents. There can

        <p class="govuk-body">
            There may be spelling errors in the ownership names which reflect the way they have been entered in the

            the date the latest proprietor was added. This could mean it is not necessarily when the overseas company

        <p class="govuk-body">
            An overseas corporation will become owner of a registered property when land is transferred to it or leased
            under a registerable lease.
            The transfer or lease must be completed by registration or, if the land is unregistered, it will trigger
            first
            registration of the land.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            An application for registration must be made using prescribed forms; this will be form AP1 for registered
            land
            or form FR1 for first
            registration. The form requires the applicant to state the territory of incorporation of the corporation
            and, if
            it has a registered
            number in England and Wales, the registration number and prefix. Other HM Land Registry forms, such as
            transfer
            form TR1, also require
            the applicant to state the territory of incorporation of the corporation and, if it has a registered number
            in
            England and Wales,
            the registration number and prefix. When we enter the corporation in the register, HM Land Registry practice
            is
            to enter the territory
            of incorporation and any registration number. This has been the case since 1997.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            In some countries, a corporation is registered in a particular state or province. In this case, HM Land
            Registry
            enters both the state
            or province and the country. For example: <b>MONTBLANC HOLDINGS LIMITED</b> (incorporated in British
            Columbia,
            Canada).

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          HM Land Registry is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          This website is partially compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The content below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list">
          <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            WCAG 2.1 A - criterion 1.3.2
            <br>
            Some table headers and captions are missing. This means it is hard to understand the content of the table and makes navigation more difficult.
          </li>
          <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            WCAG 2.1 A - criterion 2.4.4<br>
            The service fails on this criterion because:
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>some email links do not warn the user that the link will open a new window</li>
              <li>the navigation is not clear on some back links in the service. Users go back to a previous point on the page and not the previous page</li>
              <li>there are 2 broken links on the service error page</li>
              <li>there are 2 links where the purpose of the link is not clear</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            WCAG 2.1 AA - criterion 2.4.7<br>
            Some links do not change colour if the user navigates to them using the keyboard.
          </li>
          <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            WCAG 2.1 AA - criterion 3.2.3<br>
            The service fails on this criterion because:
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>back to top links are missing on some long pages which means navigation is not consistent across the service</li>
              <li>some hover text say that links open in a new tab but they open in the same tab</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            WCAG 2.1 AA - criterion 3.3.3<br>
            Some error messages are not helpful. They do not give enough information on how to correct the error.
          </li>
          <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            WCAG 2.1 AA - criterion 4.1.1<br>
            Some of the code may cause conflicts in the browser and with assistive technology. This means that the page may not work reliably for all users.
          </li>
          <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            WCAG 2.1 AA - criterion 4.1.3<br>
            Error message on sign-in page does not help the user fix the error.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">We plan to fix these errors by 31 March 2020.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>
        
        <ul class="govuk-list">
          <li>
          WCAG 2.1 A - criterion 1.3.1
          <br>
          There are 2 address fields that are not labelled. This is to allow flexibility for the user when entering an address. This pattern is part of the GOV.UK design system.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We link to external websites from this service. They are not under control of HM Land Registry and are out of scope for this accessibility statement.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How we tested this website</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          This website has been tested between 8 January 2020 and 12 February 2020. Tests were carried out by an independent internal audit team using our test suite in Quality Centre. This is an industry standard tool.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We tested our main website platform, available at <a class="govuk-link" href="{{ config['SITE_URL'] }}" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">{{ config['SITE_URL'] }}</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We've written this statement based on the defects found as at 12 February 2020. As we are still building this service, we'll continue to
          test it and all new pages. We'll update this statement as we find or fix any defects.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">
